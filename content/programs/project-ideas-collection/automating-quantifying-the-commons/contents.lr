title: Automating Quantifying the Commons
---
problem:
The Quantifying the Commons project has seen excellent additions led by student
developers. However, the scope of previous projects did not include automation
or combined reporting.
---
expected_outcome:
Add automation of data gathering and report generation so that our reports
quantifying the commons are never more than 3 months out of date.
---
contributor_tasks:
The contributor will need to architect a data flow, formalize data formats,
automate data gathering, and automate reporting. Challenges include quota
limits that may require multi-day/multi-step data gathering, deciding on plain
text vs binary data formats, and secret management. Knowledge of numpy and
matplotlib python libraries will be very helpful.
---
application_tips:
- Engage with the repository (issues, pull requests)
- Be helpful and welcoming (e.g. answer other contributors’ questions on Slack)
