title: Create local Ansible Dev environment using Docker
---
problem:
The enhancement of system architectures through the strategic transition from
SaltStack to Ansible for provisioning, coupled with the implementation of
Docker infrastructure, represents a significant step towards improved
efficiency and scalability.
---
expected_outcome:
The project's goal is to create a strong and local development setup using
Ansible and Docker. This setup will be like a real work environment, with a
special server for security (Bastion), automation with Ansible, a server for
websites, and a server for storing data. This setup will make developing things
easier and safer, and it will be a model for how we do similar projects at CC
in the future.

Docker containers:
- Bastion (SSH jump server)
- Ansible
- Web server (Apache2/WordPress)
- Database server (MariaDB)
---
contributor_tasks:
Contributor will:
- Set up Docker containers for the Bastion server, Ansible server, Web server,
  and Database server.
- Implement a secure system for managing and using secrets
  - Set up a secure storage solution for managing secrets, such as Ansible Vault
  - It is recommended to inject secrets into containers at runtime as needed,
    and not stored within container images.
- Configure Ansible playbooks for deploying the web application and interact
  with the database.
- Document the setup process
---
application_tips:
- Engage with the repository (issues, pull requests)
- Be helpful and welcoming (e.g. answer other contributorsâ€™ questions on Slack)
